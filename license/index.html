Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license.

If the licensor‚Äôs permission is not necessary for any reason‚Äìfor example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright‚Äìthen that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable. <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors_and_licensees#Considerations_for_licensees" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">More considerations for the public</a>.</p></li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="creative-commons-attribution-sharealike-40-international-public-license"></a>Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License<a class="hash-link" href="#creative-commons-attribution-sharealike-40-international-public-license" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License (&quot;Public License&quot;).
