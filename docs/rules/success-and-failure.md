## Dice

_Remedy_ uses several kinds of polyhedral dice. These dice are called by the number of sides they have. For example, the twenty-sided die is commonly called a "d20". When these dice are used, the rules specify how many dice and what kind should be used, as well as other information. For example, 3d6+7 would mean rolling three six-sided dice, adding their results together, and adding 7 to the total.

:::note
The 10-sided die, is a little special compared to the other dice: It is numbered 0–9, but when rolled on its own, a 0 is treated as 10. Numbers between 1 and 100 can be generated using a pair of these, also known as a d100. One of the pair is multiplied by ten, and then they are added together, with a total result of 0 being treated as 100. Some d10s called "percentile dice" are specially marked to be used in this way, displaying multiples of ten on its faces 00–90. When something specifies a percent chance, a d100 is used.

## Checks

Most of the story can be resolved through roleplay, but many situations have a degree of uncertainty, requiring the indifferent randomness of dice to determine the result. Checks use dice to determine how luck plays into the situation, and together with a character's natural abilities and skills determine the outcome. The Storyteller can call for a check when such a situation arises.

There are two main kinds of checks: contests, which are when two parties roll dice against each other, and static checks, which are when one party rolls against a target number called difficulty. Both kinds of checks use the twenty-sided dice as the main determining factor of success or failure. The steps for either kind of check is as follows:

1. **Roll the d20\(s\).** How many you roll depends on your proficiency for the check. See the rules for proficiency [here](ability-scores-and-skills.md#proficiency).
2. **Add the appropriate ability score.** All checks fall under one of the four ability scores, which you can read about [here](ability-scores-and-skills.md#ability-scores). Add the applicable ability score to the result of the dice roll.
3. **Add circumstantial bonuses and penalties.** Add advantage, disadvantage, and any other bonuses and penalties, such as those created by the environment, spells, or other abilities.
4. **Compare results.** In a contest, the party with the highest number wins. In a static check, success occurs if the result is higher than or equal to the difficulty. Most checks end at this step.
5. **Determine the margin of success \(or failure\).** Sometimes, the amount by which you succeed or fail matters. In a contest, your margin is obtained by subtracting your opponent's result from your own. In a static check, you subtract the difficulty from your result. If you lost a contest or failed a static check, this number will be negative.

:::info Ties
Ties are always broken in favor of the defending party. If no party can be identified as defending, break the die with a coin flip, rock-paper-scissors, or something else quick and easy. Regardless, the margin of success and failure is 0 for both parties.

:::tip Degrees of Success
It is important for the Storyteller to remember checks can result in "degrees of success"; meaning that success and failure does not have to be precise. A successful check might only mean progress towards a desirable goal, and failure might only be a temporary setback.

### Difficulty

Some situations require a check, but a contest isn't applicable. Such situation include lifting a heavy box, resisting the harmful effects of a poisoned drink, or tying a knot in the midst of a furious typhoon. In these cases, a check is made against a static number called difficulty. Below is a table to help illustrate the range of difficulties, and when to use them:

| Difficulty | Result | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Trivial | 0–4 | Noticing something in plain sight |
| Easy | 5–9 | Finding an uncommon book in a library |
| Moderate | 10–14 | Breaking down a typical wooden door |
| Hard | 15–19 | Learning a new language over the course of a month |
| Punishing | 20–24 | Crafting a magical weapon |
| Insane | 25–29 | Free-climbing an icy cliff in a thunderstorm |
| Impossible | 30+ | Inventing a completely new type of spell |

:::caution
Not all situations have a degree of uncertainty at all. The Storyteller has the right to determine success or failure without a check.

### Triumph & Disaster

When making a check, the d20 may produce a 1 or a 20. These fairly rare rolls trigger triumph and disaster, reflecting the extremes of both good and bad luck.

If the unmodified result of the roll is 20 \(after dice modifiers\), this triggers triumph. When triumph occurs, all disadvantage is ignored, and something good should occur in addition to the normal consequences of the check's result. The Storyteller will decide what this additional benefit is according to the situation.

If the unmodified result of the roll is 1 \(after dice modifiers\), this triggers disaster. When disaster occurs, all advantage is ignored, and something bad should occur in addition to the normal consequences of the check's result. The Storyteller will decide what this additional drawback is according to the situation.

In a contest, if both parties get triumph or disaster, they cancel out and are ignored. If one party gets triumph and another gets disaster, both apply separately.

Some effects may increase the possibility of triumph or disaster by increasing the amount of "natural" dice results that trigger them. These effects will specify the new range, such as "1–3" or "18–20".

### Advantage & Disadvantage

Sometimes, circumstances alter the likelihood of success, such attempting to enter a noble's mansion while having a good local reputation, or trying to haggle prices with a merchant whom you just offended. Advantage adds a bonus die to a check, reflecting a positive circumstance, while disadvantage is the opposite: a penalty die that is subtracted from a check.

Multiple circumstances may simultaneously impose advantage or disadvantage, so the kind of die used is determined by the number of advantages or disadvantages. One advantage or disadvantage uses a d4, two uses a d6, three uses a d8, four uses a d10, and five or more uses a d12. If circumstances cause a check to have both advantage and disadvantage, each advantage cancels out one disadvantage, and the remaining advantage or disadvantage is applied.
