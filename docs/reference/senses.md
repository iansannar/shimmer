Senses may specify a range in parentheses after the sense type. Past this range, a sense does not work at all \(or not well enough to matter\). It is possible to have multiple senses, though this is rare.

## Vision <a id="vision"></a>

Creatures with vision can sense things within range using light. This typically is restricted to line of sight, but transparent or reflective objects may allow observation of things behind obstacles, as long as there is sufficient light.

If no range is specified for vision, it is assumed to be 2 miles or 3 kilometers.

## Darkvision <a id="darkvision"></a>

Creatures with darkvision can sense things within range using light. This typically is restricted to line of sight, but transparent or reflective objects may allow observation of things behind obstacles. In addition, creatures with darkvision can see in nonmagical darkness as if it was very dim light. Darkvision includes normal vision, which extends past the range of the darkvision.

## Tremorsense <a id="tremorsense"></a>

Creatures with tremorsense can accurately sense movement within range through vibrations and sound. Motionless objects and creatures can also be sensed with tremorsense, but only coarsely \(with disadvantage\).

## Sphynxvision <a id="sphynxvision"></a>

Creatures with sphynxvision can sense things within range using light; however, nothing blocks line of sight. All objects can be sensed, as long as there is sufficient light. Darkvision includes normal vision.

## Truevision <a id="truevision"></a>

Creatures with truevision can sense things within range using magic. Creatures with truevision are aware of all objects and creatures, as well as the absence or presence of magic.
