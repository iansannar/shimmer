## Senses

Each character has a method by which they percieve the world. By default, all characters have regular vision.

## Speed

Each character has a walking, climbing, and swimming speed. By default, all characters have a walking speed of 30, and swimming and climbing speeds of 15.

## Traits

Each character has one major and two minor traits, which gives them special abilities.

### Major Traits

- **Adaptive:** When you finish a long rest, you can choose one ability score, increasing it by 1 until you use this trait again.
- **Bend Luck:** Three times per short rest, you may make any check with advantage. You may willingly suffer disadvantage on any check thereafter, regaining one use of this trait each time you do so.
- **Mimic:** Once per long rest, you may alter your physical appearance to look and sound like another humanoid you have seen and heard for up to 10 minutes. This alteration holds up to physical inspection, though it is only accurate for the areas of the body you have seen. Your appearance prematurely returns to normal if you fail any Sanity or Willpower check, or if you fall Unconscious.
- **Primal Endurance:** Once per long rest, you may ignore the first Near-Death Experience you would otherwise have.
- **Tail:** You have a tail, which you can use as an additional appendage to grab, hold, or use items.
- **Tremorsense:** You have tremorsense (15). You may choose to not have normal vision, in which case you instead have tremorsense (30).
- **Wings:** You have a pair of wings. These wings grant you a flying speed of 40. This speed is reduced by 10 while you wear medium or heavy armor, and you can't carry another creature while flying.

### Minor Traits

- **Amphibious:** You can breathe water and hold your breath for twice as long.
- **Blessing:** As part of a short or long rest, you may touch one creature, healing them from one wound.
- **Clearheaded:** You have +1 defense against spiritual damage.
- **Darkvision:** You have darkvision (30).
- **Elemental Affinity:** You have +1 defense against elemental damage.
- **Jack of All Trades:** When you finish a short rest, you can choose one novice skill, making all checks with that skill as if you had standard level proficiency until you use this trait again.
- **Luck Thief:** Once per short rest, when a creature you can see makes a check, you can impose disadvantage on that check and gain advantage on your next check.
- **Luminescence:** Once per short rest, you can cause part of your body to emit light. This light lasts for 1 hour or until you dismiss it as a bonus action. The light sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius, and dim light for another 20 feet beyond that.
- **Mana Talent:** You learn or gain proficiency with one trick of your choice.
- **Natural Armor:** You have +1 defense against physical damage.
- **Natural Weapon:** Part of your body is an unusually effective weapon. You ignore the Shock property when you make Unarmed attacks.
- **Prophecy:** When you finish a short or long rest, you can roll a d20 and record the result. You can replace the result of any one check thereafter with that recorded result.
- **Swift:** One of your speeds (walking, climbing, swimming, or flying) increases by 10.
