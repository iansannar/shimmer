## Assign Ability Scores

Each character must have numbers assigned to each of their four ability scores. You can assign each number in the following list to each of your character's ability scores, in any order: +1, ±0, ±0, -1.

Alternatively, you can assign any number between -5 and +5 to each score, provided that the resulting sum of all four scores is 0.

## Choose a Heritage

Each character has a heritage, which influences their natural, inborn characteristics. Choose a heritage for your character.

## Choose an Origin

Each character has an origin, a description of their background before they began adventuring. Origins provide proficiency with skills, tools, and weapons. Choose an origin for your character.

## Level 1 & Beyond

Each character has a level, which represents that character's experience and power. Each time a character advances a level, including level 1, that character gains new abilities and grows stronger.

There are two main ways to determine the abilities a character gains when they level up: classes or customized. Classes are a preset list of which abilities to take in order to build a certain character archetype \(such as a barbarian, druid, or wizard\), and a customized character requires more work and strategy but allows complete control over which abilities a character obtains. Both methods provide tables that show which abilities are available at each level.

### Mana

The amount of mana a character has access to increases as they level up. 

### Training

Training are points you gain as a character levels up that represent the time and effort they invest into learning or improving their abilities. Gambits, spells, and tricks can be learned by spending training. Each gambit, spell, or trick costs 1 training to learn or increase proficiency with, and proficiency with a weapon or tool can also be increased by spending 1 training.

### Classes

All classes provide fighting & magical talents, as well as perks.
