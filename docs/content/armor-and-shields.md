## Armor

Not all attacks can be consistently evaded, and some sources of damage are impossible to dodge at all. Armor serves as a protection against different kinds of damage by providing Defense.

### Light Armor

| Armor | Strength Minimum | Defense |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| Padded Clothing | -1 | 2 vs. physical |
| Leather Armor | -1 | 2 vs. physical, 1 vs. elemental |
| Reinforced Leather | ±0 | 3 vs. physical, 1 vs. elemental |

### Medium Armor

| Armor | Strength Minimum | Defense |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| Chain Shirt | ±0 | 4 vs. physical |
| Breastplate | +1 | 4 vs. physical, 2 vs. elemental |
| Scale Mail | +1 | 5 vs. physical, 2 vs. elemental |

### Heavy Armor

| Armor | Strength Minimum | Defense |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| Chain Mail | +2 | 6 vs. physical |
| Splint Armor | +2 | 6 vs. physical, 3 vs. elemental |
| Full Plate | +3 | 7 vs. physical, 3 vs. elemental |

#### Expert

You may ignore the minimum strength requirement for any armor you are an expert with.

## Shields

Shields can also provide Defense, but unlike armor, they must be actively used in order to be effective. When a creature you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to apply the shield's Defense against that attack.

| Shield | Strength Minimum | Defense |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| Wicker Shield | -1 | +1 vs. physical |
| Wooden Shield | ±0 | +1 vs. physical, elemental |
| Metal Shield | +1 | +2 vs. physical, elemental |
| Tower Shield | +2 | +3 vs. physical, elemental |

:::info
#### Novice

When using shields when you are incompetent with them, you must first succeed a difficulty 10 Reflex check in order to apply the shield's Defense.

#### Expert

You may use a shield as a weapon if you are an expert with them. Shields use the statistics for a club when used in this way.
